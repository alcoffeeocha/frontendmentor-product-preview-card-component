## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox & Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Flex children equal columns](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/) - This is good to read, but, I end up with just giving width 50% for both columns
